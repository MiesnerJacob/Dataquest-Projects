The institute already has a team of engineers that will build the app, but they need me to create the logical core of the app and calculate probabilities. For the first version of the app, they want me to focus on the 6/49 lottery and build functions that can answer users the following questions:\n",

    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize with a single ticket?\n",
    "* What is the probability of winning the big prize if we play 40 different tickets (or any other number)?\n",
